# Musical-Votes

As a user
So that I can vote for my favourite music tracks of all time
I want to be able to select my ten most treasured music tracks and submit them to a website
This will contribute to a definitive list of the best tracks of all time, as voted for by the public.

As a music enthusiast
So that I can view the definitive list of best tracks of all time as voted for by the public
I want to be able to visit a website that lists the best 1,000 tracks of all time.

As a music journalist
So that I can write a piece on this list of best tracks of all time
I want to be able to view which artists have the highest contributions in this list.

As a contemporary music historian
So that I can understand which decade is the most popular amongst the public for music
I want to be able to see the year in which each contributing track was released.
